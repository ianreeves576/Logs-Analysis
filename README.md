# Logs-Analysis

-This is a program that runs Python Code that runs queries that extracts three specific questions from the database.

In this project I created a reporting tool that prints text from data on the database that answer the following questions:

-What are the most popular three articles of all time?
-Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
-On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

## Installation Instructions
1. First Fork and Clone the Logs-Analysis Repo. 
2. Then open up a terminal, cd into the directory you cloned Logs-Analysis in to.
3. Finally, run the python file called 'query_runner.py' by typing in the command "python query_runner.py" in your command line.

### About the files.
In this project, there is a file that coneects to the database, one that formats the print statements properly, and individual files that run queries and print statements that make it easy for the viewer to understand. Finally, a file called 'query_runner.py'was created to import the files containing the queries and print them out one after the other.
